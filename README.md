# Arduino-Thermometer
Simple thermometer on Arduino as part of the biophysics of the senses course.

I designed a thermometer that displays the temperature using two 7-segment displays, two LEDs, and one RGB LED.
The displays show tens and ones in degrees Celsius. If the number of degrees is greater than or equal to one hundred, an additional red LED lights up, while if the number of degrees is less than zero, a blue LED is activated if the temperature is in the range
